    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        My name is Ujwal Mantri, and I'm in my first year at MIT-WPU, pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and
        Engineering.
        I've always been drawn to problem-solving and logical thinking, which is why computer science excites me it
        feels
        like solving puzzles with real-world impact.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy mathematics and playing chess. These hobbies keep me sharp, balanced, and
        constantly learning new ways to push myself. On the lighter side, I'm also a big fan of cats
        and coffee; two things that never fail to brighten my day.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm curious, motivated, and excited to explore, build, and grow-both in tech and in life.
